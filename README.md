# Welcome to My Project Portfolio  

Hello!  I'm a Financial Mathematics Masters Student based in Raleigh NC.  This profile serves as a showcase of some of my academic and personal projects—from financial modeling to Bayesian analysis and machine learning.  Each repository demonstrates skills in statistical programming, time‑series forecasting, data cleaning, reporting, and collaborative development.  

## Featured Projects  

| Project | Overview | Main Tech |  
|---|---|---|  
| **R2D2Project** | Final project for **ST502**, analysing the *R2D2* paper.  This private repository centres on statistical techniques and replicating results with R. | R, Shell |  
| **AlphaPortfolioGroup** | Team project exploring portfolio construction and alpha generation.  The repo is organised by contributor and showcases collaborative workflow and code organisation. | Python/R (mixed) |  
| **Bayesian‑Basketball** | Private assignment exploring Bayesian methods applied to basketball data.  Includes LaTeX‑formatted report templates and R scripts for simulation and model fitting. | LaTeX, R |  
| **VIX‑Project** | Public project for **FIM500** investigating the VIX (Volatility Index).  Contains Jupyter notebooks for EDA and models such as ARMA, SARIMA, LSTM and random forests ([github.com](https://github.com/t-creech/Muni-Bond-Credit-Risk)). | Jupyter Notebook |  
| **Yield‑Curve‑Modelling‑and‑PCA** | Models the yield curve using PCA.  Cleaned data pipeline and code are organised in `src/` with a simple Makefile and environment definition.  The README explains it is *“a project aiming to model the yield curve”* ([github.com](https://github.com/t-creech/Yield-Curve-Modelling-and-PCA)). | Python, Makefile |  
| **Muni‑Bond‑Credit‑Risk** | Investigates machine‑learning approaches to credit‑spread estimation for municipal bonds.  Combines Jupyter notebooks and Python modules; a central aim is to model credit spreads using ML techniques ([github.com](https://github.com/t-creech/Muni-Bond-Credit-Risk)). | Jupyter Notebook, Python, Makefile |  

## About Me  

I’m passionate about using statistics and machine learning to solve real‑world problems, especially in finance.  My projects demonstrate:  

- **Data wrangling & EDA** – cleaning financial time series and large basketball datasets.  
- **Modeling & forecasting** – implementing ARMA/SARIMA, PCA, Bayesian models, and neural networks.  
- **Reproducibility** – leveraging notebooks, RMarkdown reports, environment files, and Makefiles to ensure others can replicate results.  
- **Collaboration** – contributing within group projects and maintaining clear code organisation and documentation.  

If you’re interested in my work or would like to collaborate, feel free to explore these repositories and reach out via GitHub.  Thanks for visiting my profile!
